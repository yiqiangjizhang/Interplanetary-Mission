# Interplanetary Mission Design
Preliminary Design Of The Trajectory For An Interplanetary Mission Between Earth And Saturn With Natural Gravitatory Assistance From Jupiter.

## Problem statement
It is required to send a scientific mission to Saturn. To get to the planet of the rings, two possibilities are contemplated. One is to send an interplanetary probe directly on an elliptical Hohmann transfer path whose aphelion coincides with the radius of Saturn's orbit, and once the spacecraft encounters the planet, it is inserted into a circular orbit 106 km from Saturn between Rhea and Titan for scientific observations. To carry out the complete transfer we need two velocity pulses, one to enter the heliocentric transfer orbit and the other to slow the spacecraft and perform the orbital insertion in its encounter with Saturn.

The second possibility consists of sending the probe in a heliocentric elliptical path of lower energy that cuts the orbit of Jupiter whose aphelion does not reach the orbit of Saturn and in its encounter with Jupiter, perform a natural gravitational assistance maneuver that results in a new trajectory heliocentric with enough energy to reach Saturn. In its encounter with Saturn, the spacecraft is inserted into a circular orbit 106 km from Saturn.
